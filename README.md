# Health-ID-Verification: 

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a blockchain-based Health-ID verification system that leverages Ethereum smart contracts and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for secure and transparent verification of Health-IDs. It includes a web-based UI to interact with the smart contracts, store Health-IDs, and verify them using digital signatures.

The Health-ID Verification system allows for:
  1) Storing Health-IDs on the blockchain.
  2) Verifying Health-IDs using ECDSA signatures.
  3) Measuring performance metrics such as verification time, false positives, and false negatives.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: 

  1) Ethereum: Blockchain platform for smart contracts.
  2) Solidity: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
  3) React.js: Frontend framework for the UI.
  4) Web3.js: Ethereum JavaScript API for blockchain interaction.
  5) Truffle: Development framework for Ethereum.
  6) Ganache: Local blockchain for testing.
  7) Python: Used for performance metric analysis.


PREREQUISITES:

  1) Node.js and npm
  2) Truffle
  3) Ganache (local Ethereum blockchain)
  4) Python with web3 library installed (pip install web3)


PROJECT STRUCTURE:

  1) contracts/: Contains Solidity smart contracts for the Health-ID verification system.
        HealthIDVerification.sol: Main smart contract for storing and verifying Health-IDs.
  2) client/: React-based frontend to interact with the smart contract.
        src/HealthIDVerification.js: Main React component for Health-ID storage and verification.
        src/HealthIDVerification.css: Styles for the UI.
  3) migrations/: Truffle migrations to deploy the contract.
  4) build/contracts/: Compiled contract artifacts (JSON files generated by Truffle).
  5) performance_metrics.py (inside build/contracts/): Python script to measure the efficiency and accuracy of the verification process. It connects to the blockchain and evaluates factors like verification time, false positives, and false negatives.
  6) truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file.

SMART CONTRACT COMPILATION AND DEPLOYMENT:

  1) truffle init -> Initialize truffle project.
  2) truffle compile -> Compile the smart contracts.
  3) truffle migrate --network development -> Deploy the contracts to the development network.
After deployment, Truffle generates a corresponding JSON file for each smart contract inside the build/contracts/ directory that contains important information about the deployed contracts.

RUNNING THE REACT UI:

  1) Navigate to the client directory.
  2) npm start -> To start the React app.

PERFORMANCE METRICS EVALUATION:
  
  1) Ensure local blockchain (Ganache) is running.
  2) Run the script: python performance_metrics.py
